Structuring your code with spaces, tabs and new lines is very simple just press enter on a new structure of block like this goto start;

int Binary_Search(int Searched_Element, int Searched_Array[], int The_Amount_Elements) {
	int m, l, r; // No space here because it’s after the start of a new structure
	// space because next one is for
	for(l = 0, r = The_Amount_Elements - 1, m = (l + r) / 2; l != r; m = (l + r) / 2) {
    	if(Searched_Array[m] == Searched_Element) {
        	return m + 1;
    	}
	// space because next one is if
    	if(Searched_Array[m] < Searched_Element) {
        	l = m + 1;
    	}

    	if(Searched_Array[m] > Searched_Element) {
        	r = m - 1;
    	}
	}

	if(Searched_Array[m] == Searched_Element) {
    	return m + 1;
	}else{ // no space here because else is a PART of a structure but not itself
    	return -1;
	} // no space because next line is END of block of structure...
}

I hope i dont have to explain space and tabs because you have to be very autistic to fuck up those.. Press space between special symbols like 
calculations and &, between < and > and , its just basic stuff but i still have to say it no matter, since i still see many people not create 
space bar like wtf man im not supposed to clean your shit. goto start;

#include <iostream>
// between each one there is space because thats simply how it should be no more due to see 
using namespace std;

int Amount_Elements, Search_Element, Array[101];
start:
Spacing inside blocks should be made between every line and different structure except when it starts and ends like inside like out hehe 
goto start;



int Calculate_Fenwick_Tree(int i, int Tree[]) {
	int j = 0; // not one here because start, but one after because while

	while(i >= 1) {
    	j += Tree[i]; // again not one at the start, but rather one after because its a different line
	
    	i-=i&(-i);
	}

	return j; // not one after because its end of function (block of structure)
}

That is basically it for today i will see how muchi will write but do remember it is not that hard to have good code, just try and after some 
time it will come naturally, like how do you think the people train their cats to poop in the human toilet AND flush like… it doesnt happen 
overnight, neither will learning how to code properly will. I will see what to write later maybe it will be about naming of variables who 
knows (well i and you the reader will, because i will write it kind of weird of saying “who knows” at the end of sentences you know but 
whatever)
